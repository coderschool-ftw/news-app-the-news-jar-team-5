## User Stories

The following **required** functionalities are completed (this is a sample):

* [ ] The user can see a list of the 20 latest top news stories, loaded dynamically from our api
* [ ] For each story, the user sees a headline, the source, a link to more, and an image
* [ ] The user can see the total number of stories currently shown
* [ ] The user can click a link at the bottom of the page to load the next 20 stories. The page does not refresh. 
* [ ] The user can see how long ago the story was published in a human-friendly format; e.g. "15 minutes ago". 

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] The user can see a checkbox for every unique source of the articles loaded. For example, if the user loads four stories, and two stories are from bbc-news, one from cnn, and one from spiegel-de, the user would see three checkboxes: bbc-news, cnn, spiegel-de.
* [ ] Next to the source name, the user sees a number representing the number of stories from that source. To continue the previous example: bbc-news (2), cnn (1), spiegel-de (1).
* [ ] The user can toggle the checkbox to hide or show stories from that source in the list.
* [ ] The user should see new stories related to the category he/she chose.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

* [x] List anything else cool you did
